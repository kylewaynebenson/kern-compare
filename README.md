# Kern Compare
 Upload two fonts to compare their kerning tables and visualize differences

## Overview
Kern Compare is a tool for analyze kerning differences between two font files. This helps in identifying inconsistencies or improvements in kerning tables during font development or in identifying which kerning pairs were modified between versions. A custom visualization will highlight pairs that were added, removed, or which had their values adjusted.

Features:
- Upload and compare two font files side by side
- Visual highlighting of kerning differences
- Detailed kerning pair comparison tables
- Export comparison results
